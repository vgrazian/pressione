- The PDF opens or can be inspected by a PDF library.
- Page count matches the request.
- Page size and orientation are correct.
- File is not accidentally encrypted or password-protected unless requested.

## Visual verification

- Rendered pages show no clipped text.
- No important content overlaps.
- Margins are consistent.
- Headers, footers, and page numbers are aligned.
- Images and charts are sharp enough for the intended use.
- Tables are readable and not split awkwardly.
- No black boxes, missing glyphs, or broken transparency.

## Content verification

- Names, dates, titles, numbers, totals, and page references are checked.

- Form values are visible after filling.

## Design quality
